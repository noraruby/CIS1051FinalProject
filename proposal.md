# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Running Routes

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that allows users to input running preferences and returns a running route within a vertain radius of Temple University.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Since I came to Temple, I have really enjoyed running through the city. However, I often get sick of doing the same routes. This software will allow users to input specific details about what kind of route they would like to run. Then, I will program my favorite running routes into the software. When runners eneter details about their desired distance, as well as start and end points, the code will suggest one of my pre-programed routes to best match their input. In addition, the code will generate instructions for the run, such as when to turn or when the route requires major road crossings. To execute the code, I will use geopy and folium, which are programs outlined in the following article: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-plot-a-route-on-a-map-fb900a7f6605.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, I want to accomplish being able to visualize a few of my favorite routes using map programs.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be generating these routes also with printed directions for correctly executing them.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best scenerio would allow users to not only view the routes, but to also enter information about their running plan to be matched to the ideal route for them.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First, I will follow the article linked above to learn more about using geopy and folium. I will practice using the instructions provided there. Then, I will work on identifying my favorite routes and also creating some new ones to cover the wider city area. I will also make sure that I design routes of all lengths with many different starting coordinates. The next step would be to code printed instructions that tell runners how to correctly follow each route. Then, I will need to focus on generating details about each route that could correspond to user inputs. I will have to decide what information distinguishes each route so that the user can receive a route similar to their input. This step will require the most work, so I plan on getting the earlier parts of the project done more quickly, probably within the next week or so.
