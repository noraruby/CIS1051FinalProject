# CIS1051FinalProject

Welcome to my final project! This project is called "Your Perfect Running Route." The program is meant to generate 16 different running routes depending on a runner's inputs of desired distance and scenery. All routes begin at Temple University and follow a suitable path for pedstrians. The program shows both the map with street names and also calculates the precise route distance for runners. The program is set to autumatically open a map file in the user's browser. 

All sources are commented within the program. 

The file titled "runningroutesfinalproject" is the end product. Please refer to this for the most updated code. The other files all reflect my progress.
