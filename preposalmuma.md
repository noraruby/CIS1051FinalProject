# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I would like to relate my physics major to this python class and create some kind of program that visually demonstrates a physics concept. I am exploring the possibility of analyzing beam deflections within python, which would utilize graphing and file reading. I am also interested in writing a program for a project I read about online where scientists have attempted to count and plot the stars in the night sky.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I am doing the project alone

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Not at the moment.
